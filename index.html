<div class="project">
<a href="projects/computie"><h2>Computie 68k</h2><img src="assets/cover-computie-smt.jpg" /></a>
<p>A series of single board computers using 68k processors, along with a
Unix-like OS that runs on them.
</p>
</div>

<div class="project">
<a href="projects/molten"><h2>Molten</h2></a>
<p>A type-inferred language and compiler, written in Rust, based on ML, Rust, and Python, and using
LLVM as the backend. It can compile to LLVM IR bitcode, which can be further compiled to a native
binary.
</p>
</div>

<div class="project">
<a href="projects/nerve/"><h2>Nerve Control Network</h2><img src="assets/cover-nerve.png" /></a>
<p>A server program written in python3 that controls and coordinates devices in the home.  This project
ties together the Android Remote, RGB Nodes, and Desk Clock projects, along with various other control
and data sources, such as VLC, XMMS2, IR-controllable equipment, and
<a href="http://www.mysensors.org/">MySensors</a> wireless nodes.  A built-in web server is used as the
primary user interface.
</p>
</div>

<div class="project">
<a href="projects/rgbnode/"><h2>RGB Node</h2><img src="assets/cover-rgbnode.jpg" /></a>
<p>An Arduino-based controller for RGB LED strip lighting.  The controller has an IR receiver programmed
to read the codes from a repurposed TV remote, as well as to receive commands through USB from a computer.
Multiple controllers are able to work in unison via a MIDI-based communications bus.  The controller also
has a generic IR transmitter which can be used to control audio/visual equipment (a TV and stereo in the
current setup).
</p>
</div>

<div class="project">
<a href="projects/rgbnode-rs/"><h2>RGB Node, but with Rust on an STM32</h2></a>
<p>A port of RGBNode to Rust using an STM32F103 Bluepill board.  It uses the usbd-serial crate to communicate
with a computer, and uses the infrared crate to receive IR commands from the same repurposed TV remote.  Currently
it's only built as a prototype on a breadboard, and doesn't include the daisy-chained MIDI-based bus for controlling
multiple units
</p>
</div>

<div class="project">
<a href="projects/webmush/"><h2>WebMUSH</h2><img src="assets/cover-webmush.png" /></a>
<p>A web-based multi-user shared hallucination, in the spirit of the MUDs, MUSHes, and MOOs of the 80's and 90's.
</p>
</div>

<div class="project">
<a href="projects/conlog"><h2>Conlog</h2></a>
<p>A simple prolog interpreter with no external depedencies, written in Rust.
</p>
</div>

<div class="project">
<a href="projects/fallingrust/"><h2>Falling Rust</h2><img src="assets/cover-fallingsand.png" /></a>
<p>A falling sand game written in Rust and compiled to Web Assembly.  A demo is available at
<a href="https://transistorfet.github.io/fallingrust">here</a>
</p>
</div>

<div class="project">
<a href="projects/abugslife/"><h2>A Bug's Life Simulator</h2><img src="assets/cover-abugslife.png" /></a>
<p>An artificial life simulator written in Rust and using the Piston game engine.  Circular creatures move around
in search of food on the tiled ground with an effect that looks like bugs.
</p>
</div>

<div class="project">
<a href="projects/acamlslife/"><h2>A Caml's Life Simulator</h2></a>
<p>A clone of the "A Bug's Life" simulator, but written in Ocaml.
</p>
</div>

<div class="project">
<a href="projects/synthetik/"><h2>Synthetik</h2></a>
<p>An arduino shield with Yamaha FM synthesizer chips, and MIDI input, to be used as an audio synthesizer
(work in progress).
</p>
</div>

<div class="project">
<a href="projects/meteorman/"><h2>Meteor Games Website</h2></a>
<p>A website written using the Meteor node.js framework, for playing some card games and tile rummy.  Play in
real time against other human players.  This project was not fully completed and has a lot of rough edges.
A demo site may be available at <a href="http://games.jabberwocky.ca/">http://games.jabberwocky.ca/</a>
</p>
</div>

<div class="project">
<a href="projects/logarithm/"><h2>Logarithm</h2></a>
<p>An IRC bot that primarily logs the chat to text files and makes them available via the web.  Logarithm also
provides some helpful features such as trivia, a decision maker, a calculator, and a system of polling/voting
among channel users.  It's been in use 24/7 since 2002.
</p>
</div>

<div class="project">
<a href="projects/sdm/"><h2>Super Duper Moo</h2></a>
<p>A MOO, inspired by LambdaMOO, that allows users to connect with an IRC client (originally intended to have
support for multiple protocols).  Written in C++, it contains it's own Scheme-like scripting language and stores
the object database in XML.
</p>
</div>

<div class="project">
<a href="projects/sdrl/"><h2>SDRL</h2></a>
<p>An obtuse and needlessly tedious interpreted language in which almost everything is a function.  The interpreter
is written in pure C and the language itself is vaugely Scheme-like with no specific definition.  The interpreter
itself can be configured for a number of different language features (different parsers, different scope rules, etc.).
</p>
</div>

<div class="project">
<a href="projects/stutter/"><h2>Stutter IRC Client</h2></a>
<p>A text-based IRC client written in C and designed for portability.  The client is/was usable and was my main IRC
client for a few years, before neglect and a lack of features drove me to use other programs.
</p>
