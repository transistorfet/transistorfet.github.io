<p>A few months ago, I wrote a 68000 emulator in Rust named
<a href="https://jabberwocky.ca/projects/moa/">Moa</a>.  My original goal was to emulate a simple
<a href="https://jabberwocky.ca/projects/computie/">computer</a> I had previously built.  After only a few
weeks, I had that software up and running in the emulator, and my attention turned to what other
platforms with 68000s I could try emulating.  My thoughts quickly turned to the Sega Genesis and
without thinking about it too much, I dove right in.  What started as an unserious half-thought of
"wouldn't that be cool" turned into a few months of fighting documentation, game programming hacks,
and my sanity with some side quests along the way, all in the name of finding and squashing bugs in
the 68k emulator I had already written.</p>
<p>This is Part III in the series.  If you haven't already read <a href="https://jabberwocky.ca/posts/2022-01-emulating_the_sega_genesis_part1.html">Part
I</a> and <a href="https://jabberwocky.ca/posts/2022-01-emulating_the_sega_genesis_part2.html">Part
II</a>, you might want to
do so.  Part I covers setting up the emulator, getting some game ROMs to run, and implementing the
DMA and memory features of the VDP.  Part II covers adding a graphical frontend to Moa, and then
implementing a first attempt at generating video output.  Part III will be about debugging the
various problems in the VDP and CPU implementations to get a working emulator capable of playing
games.  For more details on the 68000 and the basic design of Moa, check out <a href="https://jabberwocky.ca/posts/2021-11-making_an_emulator.html">Making a 68000

<h2 id="previously">Previously</h2>
<p>After about two weeks of work on adding Sega Genesis support to my emulator, I had implemented
memory operations for the video display processor (VDP), and written a draw loop to generate the
video frames according to the <a href="https://segaretro.org/images/a/a2/Genesis_Software_Manual.pdf">SEGA
documentation</a>.  The result of all
that work was this:</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/2022-01/sonic1-broken-oct-26.png" title="Sonic 1 broken SEGA screen" />
</p>

<p>This is Sonic 1 attempting to show the SEGA logo at startup.  It's better than Sonic 2 which was
just a black screen, a few log messages, and then... nothing...  The few other games I tried were no
better.</p>
<p>When I had started this project, I thought it probably wouldn't be too hard to get something as
simple as the SEGA logo working, but I was wrong.  After spending a day or two fiddling with quick
fixes that didn't fix much of anything, I committed my work in progress to git, so that I could
track and undo any changes I made, and started in to some serious debugging.  The following is my
journey of debugging, on and off over the next six weeks, until I managed to get Sonic 2 running
well enough to play.</p>
<h2 id="fixing-the-colours">Fixing The Colours</h2>
<p>The most obvious thing that was wrong was the colours, so I looked into this first.  Since I
couldn't be sure that all the data was getting into the VDP correctly, I needed to simplify the
output a bit, so I wrote an alternate <code>draw_frame()</code> function to display just the patterns instead
of the scroll tables. It would draw each pattern in memory across the screen from left to right, top
to bottom so that I could inspect them better.  They might not look like a coherent picture, being
only 8x8 pixels each and arranged in an unintended order, but it should at least show something.
The result was this:</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/2022-01/patterns-broken-colours.png" title="Display all patterns in memory" />
</p>

<p>There is definitely some kind of pattern data being displayed because the patterns are not a solid
colour, but the colours are clearly wrong.  I'm expecting some blue colours since it should be
printing the SEGA logo.</p>
<p>For about a day I was doubting and testing the transfer of data into CRAM.  I had found a minor bug
earlier in that code.  After staring at the values in CRAM for a while, I noticed that the colour
values were actually correct.  There were values of 0xEEE and 0xE00 and a few others, so it had to
be a problem with reading the CRAM to get the u32 colours value.  The code to convert CRAM values
into colours was:</p>

</code></pre></div>

<p>There had definitely been some problems with those complex shift operations, but the tricker problem
turned out to be the index into the CRAM that was wrong.  Since the CRAM is an array of u8, which
was chosen in order to reuse the same transfer and DMA code with VRAM, I needed to multiply the
index by 2 before reading the word at that location.  Now the colours actually make sense:</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/2022-01/patterns-fixed-colours.png" title="Displaying all the patterns for the SEGA logo" />
</p>

<p>Switching back to displaying the scrolls I'm now getting a white screen, but not much else.  <em>sigh</em>
In Sonic 1, parts of the SEGA logo were displayed if I only drew Scroll A or Scroll B, but
displaying both together didn't work.  I needed to add the mask colour, which is always colour 0 in
each palette.  I modified the <code>.blit()</code> method to not draw anything if the colour 0 is used (later
changed to 0xFFFFFFFF to avoid a conflict with the colour black, represented by 0), and now I was
getting something.</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/2022-01/sonic1-sega-logo-slow.gif" title="It's working, but it's very slow" />
</p>

<p>Now it's actually showing the SEGA logo!  The scrolls are finally working, even if they still don't
look right and the animation is painfully slow.</p>
<h2 id="drawing-a-blank">Drawing A Blank</h2>
<p>While Sonic 1 seemed to at least try to display something, Sonic 2 and a few other games wouldn't
display anything at all.  With the various debug messages turned on, the logs showed it was
initializing various devices and then would get caught in a loop where it would read the status word
of the VDP over and over again.  Clearly it was looking for a specific bit value in the status word
before it would move on, but I didn't know which one.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wiki.megadrive.org/index.php?title=VDP_Ports&amp;t=20120714071022#Read">status word</a> is
returned when reading (instead of writing) from the VDP's control port.  It contains a number of
status flag bits and is one of the few ways the CPU can get feedback from the VDP, with interrupts
being the other.  In my existing code, the FIFO and NTSC bits were set statically, and the DMA bit
was being set and reset during DMA operations, so it probably wasn't related to those.  Given that
this problem happens right away, it's probably not looking at the sprite flags either.  I reckon
it's something to do with the <code>HBLANK</code>/<code>VBLANK</code> bits, or possibly the <code>V Interrupt Happened</code> bit.</p>
<p>The <code>HBLANK</code> and <code>VBLANK</code> bits are set when the video output signal is in its blanking phases.  On a
CRT, it takes time after a line has been drawn for the electron beam to move back to the start of
the next line, and be ready to output the next line of data.  It also takes time (a lot more time)
after the entire screen has been drawn for the beam to move back to the top of the screen again to
start the next refresh.  Since the video signal's data is directly output to the CRT as soon as it's
received (the joys of analogue signals), the video signal itself needs to incorporate these blanking
delays where no data is sent. These blanking periods just so happen to be convenient times for the
CPU to update or change data in the VDP, when those changes wont affect the output.  This is
especially important during the vertical blanking period, when the positions of everything on the
screen can be updated at once before the next frame is drawn to prevent artifacts and glitches in
the image.</p>
<p>I was moving fast to get something working, so I quickly implemented the vertical blanking bit by
setting it just before getting to the end of the frame, at 14_218_000 ns, and then resetting the bit
at 16_630_000 ns when the frame is drawn and the vertical interrupt is triggered.</p>
<p>This worked for the time being, but it turned out to cause another error that slowed the animation
down by half, which I didn't notice until after I had the scrolling working.  It wasn't until I
could actually play the games that I noticed the problem, and by that point I had forgotten about
this bit.  It took me a day or two of debugging before I finally tracked down the problem to the
<code>VBLANK</code> bit.</p>
<p>After the vertical interrupt occurs, some games would busy wait until the vertical blanking bit was
set before actually running the game loop.  Sonic 2 is one such game, but Sonic 1 doesn't do this
check.  Since the bit is only set about 2ms before the next vertical interrupt, the game's frame
updater would only start 2ms before the next interrupt, and would still be updating the frame at
that point, so it would ignore the second vertical interrupt.  As a result, it would take two frames
of time (2 vertical interrupts) before one frame of the game would be drawn, and only one cycle of
the game loop would execute.  Sonic was moving at exactly half speed.  Doubling the amount of
simulated time fixed the issue (which didn't make any sense at first).  I even went to the trouble
of implementing more accurate instruction timing in the 68000 in order to see if it was caused by
the fact that all the instructions had previously been running in 4 clock cycles.  Shown below is
the more recent code with the fixed blanking behaviour.</p>
<p>The following code is in the updated VDP's <code>.step()</code> function, including the <code>VBLANK</code> bit handling.
The <code>HBLANK</code> code looks similar but with different timing values.</p>

<img src="images/2022-01/sonic2-sega-almost-working.png" title="Finally the SEGA logo displays correctly" />
</p>

<p>Finally!  The SEGA logo in Sonic 2 is (almost) displaying correctly.  There are a few glitches in
the logo but that's because I hadn't implemented the reverse patterns yet.  Adding support for that
fixed the logo right up.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-those-interrupts">What About Those Interrupts</h2>
<p>While Sonic 2 was now advancing enough to show the scrolls, it was very slow, the same as Sonic 1,
from the start of the program through displaying the logo and then finally getting to the title
screen.  It was taking half a minute or more.</p>
<p>My first suspicion was to check the interrupts, since it's usually the vertical interrupt that
triggers the progression of time in these games.  It's a reliable signal to use for knowing how long
to show the logo screen for, or when to read the controller input, calculate movement, and then
update the screen.  Turning on the debugging output for the interrupts showed that they weren't
occurring anywhere near as fast as they should be.  It would take seconds before an interrupt
occurred, and they would occur randomly rather than at a regular pace.</p>
<p>I'm not all that surprised given that I knew there were issues with the implementation, and I had
run into problems with them when working on Computie support, but I hadn't been sure how I wanted to
fix them.  Now I <em>needed</em> to fix them.</p>
<p>In the original implementation, there was a trait for <code>Interruptable</code> devices with a function that
would be called by the interrupt controller when an interrupt occurred, which would trigger the
interrupt handler.  That works in theory, but an interrupt might not be handled right away if
interrupts are disabled, and the callback might not be re-called when interrupts were re-enabled.
There was also no mechanism for acknowledging an interrupt, and the 68k implementation's handling of
the interrupt priority mask was buggy.  The result was that interrupts would only occur when
everything happened to line up, which wasn't very often.</p>
<p>For the 68000, an interrupt can occur with a priority between 1 and 7.  A higher number is a higher
priority, and interrupts below a certain priority number can be disabled using a priority mask value
stored in the <code>%sr</code> register.  When an interrupt occurs, the CPU will check that priority number
against the priority mask.  If the requested interrupt number is strictly higher than the mask, then
the <code>%sr</code> and <code>%pc</code> registers will be pushed onto the stack, the priority mask will be changed to
the current number (to prevent a duplicate handling of the same interrupt), and the handler will be
run.  If the interrupt priority equals or is lower than the mask, the CPU will keep running whatever
it had been running before, at least until the priority mask changes, or a higher priority unmasked
interrupt occurs.</p>
<p>For devices like the serial controller in Computie, the interrupt signal will be asserted and stay
asserted until the cause of the interrupt is manually acknowledged by writing a certain value to the
serial controller.  For the Genesis, on the other hand, the interrupts behave more like one-shots
where there is no manual acknowledgement, and the signal should be de-asserted as soon as it's
acknowledged, essentially.</p>
<p>As for the CPU, if an interrupt is masked when the signal was assert, and then unmasked while the
signal is still asserted, it will run the handler (ie. the interrupt signals are level triggered,
not edge triggered).  If the signal goes away before the interrupt is unmasked, the handler will
never be run.  </p>
<p>In hardware, interrupts will only be checked at a certain point in the CPU's cycle, usually between
the execution of instructions, so it's actually pretty reasonable for the emulated CPU to manually
check for interrupts at the end of an instruction cycle.  All it has to do is check the interrupt
controller object in <code>System</code>.  The <code>Interruptable</code> trait wasn't needed anymore.  Devices call the
interrupt controller to set an interrupt, and the CPU calls the interrupt controller to check if any
are active.  It's not a terribly complicated problem, but it's easy to get wrong in subtle ways,
such that it might work for some devices but not others.</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/2022-01/sonic2-sprites-broken.gif" title="Finally the SEGA logo displays correctly" />
</p>

<p>Now it runs at what seems like the right speed!  Lets ignore, for a minute, the other glaring
issues...</p>
<h2 id="and-now-for-something-a-little-different">And Now For Something (A Little) Different</h2>
<p>At this point, I had the colours and interrupts sorted out, the scrolls were being displayed
somewhat correctly, and the sprites were sort of working, but multi-cell sprites were still broken.
Everything I had tried to fix the sprites didn't work, and I had no idea if it was because of the
VDP implementation or a bug in the CPU.  And to make matters worse, Sonic was falling through the
floor during the gameplay.  </p>
<p>And here I got stuck.  I had been doing nothing but debugging for a week at this point, three weeks
after starting on the Genesis and about five weeks since I had started the emulator.  I had made
good progress but this last week was a grind.  There were multiple issues, both in the VDP and the
CPU.  I had already fixed the few things that really stood out, but I was running out of threads to
pull on, and getting frustrated.  I needed to try something else.</p>
<p>I had not yet proven out the 68000 implementation, so some of the problems I was encountering could
be in there and not in the VDP code.  There was no easy way to tell where the problem was without
tracing a lot of assembly code to figure out what it was <em>supposed</em> to do, looking for a one bit
change somewhere in the CPU registers or in memory.  I needed a way to test the 68000 better, and
why not try implementing another system?</p>
<p>The Macintosh 512k also used the 68000 and it's a fairly simple computer, in terms of I/O.  It had a
very basic video display circuit made from generic logic that looped through memory addresses and
shifted the bits into the video output stream.  The display only supported black and white so each
pixel was a single bit that was either on or off.  The ROMs that were embedded on the motherboard
are available at <a href="https://archive.org/details/mac_rom_archive_-_as_of_8-19-2011">archive.org</a>, so I
started making some devices and running the ROMs to see if I could find some bugs in the 68000
emulation alone.</p>
<p>At the same time, I looked into implementing the Z80 that the Genesis would also need.  Some games
seemed to get stuck waiting for the non-existent Z80 to respond, so I thought I might as well start
a Z80 implementation too.  It would be something different to work on when I was stuck on everything
else.  At least then I'd make some progress, which would encourage me to keep going.</p>
<p>In order to develop a Z80 implementation, I needed some Z80 code to run on it, and any I/O devices
that the code needed.  I could write my own Z80 code of course, but that wouldn't test the
implementation well enough, beyond just basic functioning of the instructions.  I needed code for an
existing platform, with all its expectations of how the real system behaves embedded in its logic,
and that meant implementing devices for an existing platform.  I looked around for the simplest Z80
platform I could find, which turned out to be the TRS-80.  I'm not the biggest fan of the TRS-80,
but I did have a "Model I" in my computer collection at one point (that I sadly had to sell), so it
wasn't entirely foreign to me.  I could get away with just implementing the video display and the
keyboard in order to run the BASIC interpreter that comes in its ROM.</p>
<p>Over the next month, I mostly worked on these sub-projects, as well as on another Computie hardware
iteration.  The TRS-80 implementation came together fairly smoothly apart from a bug in the Z80
implementation's shift operation that took me a day or two of tracing the <a href="http://48k.ca/L1Basic.html">Level I BASIC ROM's
assembly code</a> to fix.  (Thanks to George Phillips for the well
documented assembly code).</p>
<p>The Macintosh implementation didn't go as smoothly however.  I did manage to find and fix a few bugs
in the 68000, and I got far enough to display the Dead Mac screen, but I got stuck just before the
end of the ROM's initialization where it opens the default device drivers.  At some point, it
attempts to write to a location in the ROM.  In hardware that shouldn't have an affect, except that
I have some code in Moa to raise an error when that happens, since it's likely a bug.  Ignoring that
error didn't make it get any farther.  I couldn't for the life of me find out what was wrong, but at
one point, using another <a href="https://github.com/TomHarte/CLK">emulator</a>, I was able to confirm that if
the ROMs ran on a system that didn't mirror the RAM and ROM address exactly as the hardware does,
the ROM wont boot. <em>facepalm</em>  Effort went into making sure the Macintosh was not cloned like the
IBM PC, so I was fighting against those effort as well.  After a while I decided to give the Genesis
a try again.</p>
<h2 id="back-to-the-genesis">Back to the Genesis</h2>
<p>After getting stuck on the Macintosh implementation, I picked up the Genesis again.  I had spent
almost an entire month away.  In that time, I had worked on another hardware revision for Computie,
and wrote the article "Making a 68000 Emulator In Rust".  I also had improved the Moa debugger,
implemented the Z80 entirely, filled in a number of missing 68k instructions, and finished
implementing all the 68k instruction decoding (although a few instructions are still not implemented
because they aren't use by any code I've tried to run).  I also fixed some bugs in existing
instructions, such as MOVEM which copies data to or from multiple registers at a time.  Perhaps some
things could be fixed?</p>
<p>On the surface though, the results were the same as last time.  The scrolls were mostly working, but
the sprites were broken, and Sonic was still falling through the floor to his death.  I had added
the Z80 coprocessor into the system, now that it was implemented (I might as well), but I had left
the Z80 address space as one big 64 KB <code>MemoryBlock</code>.  The Z80 alone didn't changed anything in
Sonic 2, or in Sonic 1, which was still getting stuck at the title screen as it a had before.</p>
<p>I needed a way to isolate the drawing of sprites so I could better figure out what was wrong, and it
was only at this point it occurred to me to search for demo and test ROMs that might help.  That
immediately turned up <a href="https://www.mode5.net/">ComradeOj's demos</a>, particularly Tiny Demo, which
scrolls some text across the screen, and GenTest v3 which contains a number of screens with
different graphics to test possible issues, including a display of some static sprites.</p>
<p>I also came across the <a href="https://www.retrodev.com/blastem/">BlastEm</a> emulator in C, which has a
builtin debugger.  I was able to modify and compile a local version which dumps out the contents of
VRAM at a specific point in a ROM's execution.  With this, I could verify that the data in VRAM in
Moa was correct and the DMA and transfer code was in fact working correctly.  I ended up not digging
into the BlastEm code much beyond this, but the validation it provided was extremely helpful.</p>

</p>

<p>The above image is the results of running TinyDemo.  Clearly the text is all garbled but I haven't a
clue what could be causing it.  At least it was a very small ROM, with straight-forward assembly
code.</p>
<p>The first thing I could do was to try to isolate where the problem was.  Was it caused by getting
data into VRAM, or was it somewhere else.  I started by running the demo in BlastEm and dumping the
VRAM at the point in the ROM just after the VDP is initialized, at address <code>0xDE</code>.  I went to the same
point in Moa and again dumped the contents of VRAM to compare them.</p>
<p>From BlastEm, the start of VRAM where the patterns are stored looks like this:</p>

<p>It's almost the same, but if you look closely there are a few discrepancies.  Of course I was
expecting it to be caused by the transfer code, but I traced the assembly for TinyDemo to see where
the data in VRAM was coming from.  There's a loop that simply copied data from RAM address
<code>0xFF0000</code> into VRAM address <code>0x0000</code>.  I dumped the contents of RAM at that location and sure
enough, the difference occurred there too, so it was something further up the chain.  Finally I was
making some progress now that I could narrow down the problems better.</p>
<p>Tracing back in the disassembled output quickly led to the <code>decompress</code> function, which loads and
decompresses the raw binary data in the ROM into an in-memory representation that the VDP can use.</p>

<p>The above snippet only shows the main loop of the decompress function and not the beginning and
ending parts of the function.  Instructions <code>0x266</code> and <code>0x26a</code> are where a byte of data is written
to the location in RAM where the decompressed data goes, and which will then be loaded into VRAM
verbatim.</p>
<p>I knew from the above dumps that the first byte that differs occurs at offset 0x46, and dumping the
registers shows the address <code>0xFF0000</code> in register <code>%a1</code>, which is incremented each time the loop
occurs.  To get to the point of failure, I just need to set a breakpoint at <code>0x266</code> and continue
until register <code>%a1</code> contains <code>0xFF0046</code>, and then dump all the register values to look for a
difference between Moa's register values and BlastEm's.</p>
<p>Aha!  The value of <code>%d6</code> is different.  Moa has 0x2710 while BlastEm has 0x2700.  Looking at the
disassembly, the only use of <code>%d6</code> is to temporarily hold the contents of the flags register (<code>%ccr</code>
which is the lower byte of status register <code>%sr</code>).  The flag register values are also different!
The <code>Extend</code> bit, which is the 5th bit in the status register is the only difference between the two
emulators.  I was already suspicious of the flags, since they are rather complicated to simulate and
can behave differently for different instructions.  Of all the flags, the <code>Extend</code> which isn't used
by many instructions is probably the one I'm not emulating correctly, so I seem to be on the right
track.</p>
<p>Stepping through the program in BlastEm shows that the <code>Extend</code> flag is set after the <code>lsrw #1,%d5</code>
instruction, which occurs a few times in the function.  The <a href="https://www.nxp.com/files-static/archives/doc/ref_manual/M68000PRM.pdf">Motorola
Documentation</a> for the LSR
instruction shows that both the <code>Extend</code> flag and <code>Carry</code> flag should be set to the bit value
shifted out (the least significant bit).  The rust code for the <code>LSd</code> instruction, which sets the
flags, is shown below.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">set_logic_flags</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">pair</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">size</span><span class="p">);</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I must have assumed that the <code>.set_logic_flags</code> function would clear the <code>Extend</code> flag when I
originally wrote this code, as it does for the other four flags.  Most logic operations don't affect
the <code>Extend</code> flag though, so the <code>.set_logic_flags()</code> function is only clearing the lower 4 bits (the
<code>Extend</code> flag being the 5th bit).  After the call, the <code>Extend</code> and <code>Carry</code> flags are set to true
only if the bit shifted out, which is stored in<code>pair.1</code>, is true.  If the <code>Extend</code> flag was set to
true from a previous instruction, it wouldn't be cleared.  That was enough of a discrepancy to cause
the garbled text, and a whole lot more.  Effing flags...</p>
<p>While the <code>Extend</code> flag is never directly tested in a comparison in this function, there are some
<code>ROXd</code> instructions (where d is the direction (L)eft or (R)ight).  Unlike the <code>ROd</code> instruction,
which rotates bits within the same value, the <code>ROXd</code> instruction rotates through the <code>Extend</code> flag,
so the value in <code>Extend</code> will be put into the number (either the left or right end), and the bit
rotated out of the opposite end will be put into <code>Extend</code>.  So an error in the <code>Extend</code> flag could
definitely cause some problem with the <code>decompress</code> code.</p>
<p>Adding a line of code to clear the <code>Extend</code> flag before the <code>.set_logic_flags()</code> function is called
is enough to fix it.  Now the text in the demo is showing legibly.  It's still nothing like what it
looks like in BlastEm, which has a moving background that stretches the text vertically, but I'm
still calling it a win.</p>

</p>

<p>And looking at Sonic 2, it's still very garbled but Sonic is no longer falling to his death!  The
<code>Extend</code> flag in the shift and rotate instructions was the cause of whichever comparison lead to
Sonic not being on firm ground.  I didn't even have to dig into the source of that problem in the
Sonic 2 ROM to fix it, which was a relief.</p>

<h2 id="you-cant-write-there-sir">You Can't Write There, Sir</h2>
<p>Switching gears, I tried GenTestV3, which would immediately fail when run because it attempted to
write to what should have been a read only memory area (the ROM data itself).  I had added a way to
mark a <code>MemoryBlock</code> as read only, which would raise an error when the <code>.write()</code> function is called
on that block, as a means of catching errors.  It had helped catch a few things when working on the
Macintosh support, so I had added it to the Genesis ROMs as well.</p>
<p>Since I was getting an error when the attempted write occurred, I knew exactly where the fault was,
address <code>0x2976</code>, and I also knew what the values of the registers at that point were:</p>

<p>The register <code>%a4</code> contains <code>0x00000000</code>, plus an offset of 4, so it's trying to write to address
<code>0x00000004</code>, the reset vector.  That can't possibly be right.  In BlastEm, I tried setting the same
address as a breakpoint and, would you look at that, the breakpoint isn't reached!  That code isn't
even running in BlastEm when GenTest is run.  If you notice from the snippet above, <code>jmp</code>
instructions are being used to return to the calling function, and <code>bra</code>nch instructions are being
used to call them, rather than using the stack.  So the return address is not on the stack, but in
register <code>%a2</code>, which contains <code>0x2592</code> which is the instruction <em>after</em> the one that called this
function.  We're on to something here.</p>

<p>Address <code>0x258e</code> contains a branch instruction to the exact address that the erroneous write occurs
on, and before that, the return register <code>%a2</code> is loaded with the return value.  What about the
instruction before that?  It's a branch to <code>0x292c</code> which appears in the previous snippet, which
seems to be a function that sets all the register values to <code>0</code>!  Wait, why would it do that?  The
register values were almost all <code>0</code> when the error occurred, except for the two registers used as
return values, so it did run that code, but why would it clear everything just before using an
now zero'd register as an address.</p>
<p>I set a breakpoint for <code>0x2572</code>, which looked like the start of the current function, given that
there's a branch instruction just before.  The <code>%a4</code> register, interestingly enough, contains
<code>0xc00000</code>, which would make sense as the intended value of <code>%a4</code> where the erroneous write
occurred, if all the registers hadn't been cleared just before.  Most of the other registers are <code>0</code>
except for <code>%a2</code> which contains <code>0x2554</code>, possibly the return value of the caller.</p>

<p>There's a jump to the start of our function that shouldn't run at <code>0x255e</code>, which... isn't quite
what I was expecting.  I was somehow expecting the previous code to somehow make sense, but alright,
it's maybe taking a jump that shouldn't happen (even though it seems like it should <em>never ever</em>
happen), so why is it jumping when it shouldn't.</p>
<p>I set a breakpoint for <code>0x2554</code> in both emulators to see if that code would run and this time,
BlastEm runs that code.  Stepping through the code in both emulators shows the status register
values are different just after the comparison at <code>0x255a</code>.  <em>groan</em>  Not the flags again.</p>
<p>Looking closer at the code though, the values of <code>%d7</code> are different between the emulators as well.
The comparison in Moa is setting the flags correctly for the data used, but the data values are
different, and so BlastEm doesn't make the branch where Moa does.  Ok, so maybe it's not the flags
this time.  So why are the values of <code>%d7</code> different.  Well it's set just a few instructions ahead
with the lower byte value of <code>%d3</code>, which in Moa is <code>0</code>.  In BlastEm, it's 0xff.  Aha!  So where is
<code>%d3</code> set?</p>
<p>It's not set in the code just above the comparison, but there is a branch to <code>0x2a4a</code> just before
which looks like a register-returning function call, and the code at that location does change
<code>%d3</code>.</p>

<p>Tracing through the debuggers shows that this is the code where BlastEm gets 0xff into register
<code>%d3</code> and it's doing it by reading the controller input.  <code>0xa10003</code> is the byte address of the data
port for controller 1, and <code>0xa10009</code> is the control port for controller 1.  I had taken a stab at
implementing the weird <a href="https://segaretro.org/Sega_Mega_Drive/Control_pad_inputs">TH counting</a> that
the controllers need to do, but I hadn't tested it.  I had only hooked up the Start button to a key
press, which was all I had needed up until this point, to get through the title screen to the game
play.</p>
<p>Here, from the code, it seemed as if the correct behaviour, at least according to how BlastEm worked,
was for the controllers to return <code>0xff</code> when no buttons are pressed, rather than <code>0</code>.  Changing
that one thing is Moa got to the first screen of GenTest asking which test to run!  Success!  Well,
I still needed to fix the controllers properly, since button presses still didn't work, but this is
at least the cause of GenTest not running.</p>
<p>There turned out to be quite a few minor bugs in the TH counting code.  The count was incrementing
twice as often as it should have, and the button states needed to be inverted (1 means the button is
not pressed and 0 means it is).  I also needed to reset the counter when the control port was
written to, for the count to be in sync with what the ROM was expecting.  Not all ROMs progressed
through the entire count, if they only needed to read a few buttons.  Eventually I got it sorted out
and buttons were working but it took a while to get them right.  The latest code for the controllers
is <a href="https://github.com/transistorfet/moa/blob/main/src/peripherals/genesis/controllers.rs">here</a></p>
<h2 id="fixing-sprites">Fixing Sprites</h2>
<p>I had been back at it for about 4 or 5 days now and I had already ticked off two major issues.  I
could now control the characters in game play, even though I couldn't see much of what was going on
still.  The elephant in the room was those sprites not working, so with my enthusiasm high, I
pressed on to tackle the sprites.</p>
<p>Fixing the <code>Extend</code> flag bug fixed Sonic falling through the floor to his death, so that was a
significant step forward, but multi-cell sprites were still being drawn incorrectly.  Luckily the
GenTest ROM has a page that displays a static multi-pattern sprite, both forward and reversed.</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/2022-01/gentest-sprites-broken.png" title="GenTest sprites broken" />
</p>

<p>The forward sprite (Knuckles) works fine, but the reversed sprite (Sonic) is messed up.  If you look
closely, you can see the vertical columns of cells seem to line up correctly, but the horizontal
arrangement of the columns is mixed up.  This one turned out to be a bit subtle.</p>
<p>I had tried fiddling with reversing the cell drawing order in multicell sprites but to no avail.  It
turned out when switching the revere-sprite code I was changing both the order of the cells, and
also reversing the positions they were drawn in, rather than switching only one.  I was also
adjusting both coordinates instead of just the horizontal arrangement.  At the time I didn't have a
way of just drawing one sprite in one location to inspect it closely enough to figure out what was
wrong, but the GenTest ROM made it much clearer what was wrong.  I also had an off by one error with
reversed sprites where I needed to subtract one from the size in order to get the right vertical row
of patterns to use.</p>
<p>First, the existing code is shown below.  Note: Multi-cell sprites are drawn top to bottom, left to
right, unlike everything else in the Genesis, so the outer loop is for the horizontal direction, and
the inner loop is the vertical direction.  The variables that appear are defined as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>pattern_name</code> is the 16-bit pattern specifier</li>
<li><code>(h_pos, v_pos)</code> is the pixel position on screen where the sprite should be drawn</li>
<li><code>(size_h, size_v)</code> is the size in cells of the sprite</li>
<li><code>(h_rev, v_rev)</code> are bools of whether the sprite should be reversed in a given direction</li>
<li><code>self.is_sprite_on_screen(x, y)</code> returns whether those pixel positions are on-screen (sprites can
  be entirely off the screen, in which case they wont be drawn)</li>
</ul>

<p>Changing the following lines is enough to fix it.  It needs to take an extra 1 off the h and v
values when the sprite is reversed, and also use the loop's values to calculate the position where
the cell should be drawn instead of using the previously calculated cell positions, which have
already been reversed.</p>

<p>And now the sprites work!  That was surprisingly simple given how broken they looked before.  I had
been close, but it only takes an off by one error to make the output mangled beyond recognition
sometimes.</p>
<p align="center">

</p>

<p>The intro sprites in Earthworm Jim are working now too.  I had tried to use that game for testing
sprites before I had taken that break, but it wasn't as helpful as the GenTest sprite screen.</p>

<h2 id="not-all-the-data">Not All The Data</h2>
<p>How is Sonic 2 looking now that the sprites have been fixed.</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/2022-01/sonic2-dma-broken.png" title="Sonic 2 scrolls still broken" />
</p>

<p>Well... it honestly doesn't look any different.  In fact this is the same image from after the
<code>Extend</code> flag was fixed, but before the sprites were fixed.  I literally could not tell the
difference between the image before and after fixing the sprites, they were so identical, so I
didn't even bother adding another screenshot.  No wonder I couldn't fix the sprites before, when I
was using Sonic 2 to test with.  The garbled sprites in Sonic 2 were caused by something else
entirely.</p>
<p>Are there any other test screens in the GenTest ROM that looked messed up?  Sure enough, all the
video output patterns are broken.  I'll use the colour bleed test as an example.</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/2022-01/gentest-pattern-broken.png" title="GenTest colour pattern broken" />
</p>

<p>Well that's definitely not what it should look like.  Inspecting the VRAM shows shows that only
about half the data is loaded that should be loaded by comparison to BlastEm.  I found the spot in
the ROM where the data is loaded into the VDP using a DMA transfer.  The source data in RAM actually
is complete this time, even though the VRAM data is only partially present, so this time it is an
issue with transferring data into the VDP.  Playing around with the debugger in BlastEm I noticed
something in the output for the VDP state:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>**DMA Group**
13: 00 |
14: 46 | DMA Length: $4600 words
15: 00 |
16: 88 |
17: 7F | DMA Source Address: $FF1000, Type: 68K
</code></pre></div>

<p>It says the DMA length is 0x4600 <em>words</em> (not bytes).  Crap...  I had assumed that the DMA count was
in bytes, not words.  Could it really be that simple a problem?  Yup...</p>
<p>I was subtracting 2 instead of 1 from the count every iteration of the DMA loop, causing it to end
half way through the intended transfer size.  It really was that simple</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/2022-01/gentest-pattern-fixed.png" title="GenTest colour pattern fixed" />
</p>

<p>And now Sonic 2 looks like this:</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/2022-01/sonic2-scrolling-broken.png" title="Sonic2 dma fixed but scrolling still broken" />
</p>

<p>Much better!  It almost looks right except for the foreground that's out of place.  I haven't even
attempted to implement the horizontal and vertical scrolling functionality of the VDP yet, so that
must be what's going on.  This is finally coming together.</p>
<h2 id="scrolling-the-scrolls">Scrolling The Scrolls</h2>
<p>It had been less than a week since I had returned to it, and I had fixed all the glaring issues that
were mangling the graphics.  It was finally time to implement something new from the Sega docs, that
I had left for later.  Later was now!  It was time to implement the scrolling features.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, the scrolls are much bigger than can fit on the screen at once.  In order to be
able to quickly update what's shown on the screen without changing all the cell data, the scroll
planes can be moved relative to the screen to change what part of the scroll plane will appear on
the screen.  Each scroll can be moved independently of each other to create a parallax effect.</p>
<p>The vertical and horizontal scrolling work a bit differently from each other.  For one, the vertical
scroll direction has its own special memory, the VSRAM, where as the horizontal scroll data is
stored in a table in VRAM, with the starting address of the table set by a VDP register.</p>
<p>For the vertical scroll position, either a single offset can be used to move the whole plane, or
every two cells can have a different vertical offset.  Each offset is an unsigned number between 0
and 1023 (which is the maximum number of pixel of the largest possible scroll size of 128 cells).
Since VSRAM is 80 bytes, that means there can be 40 16-bit words, 20 for each of the two scrolls
interleaved with each other, which covers the maximum 40 cell width of the screen.</p>
<p>For the horizontal scroll position, either a single offset can move the whole plane, or every cell
can have a different offset, or every line can have a different offset.  For the cell offset
setting, only a maximum of 30 offsets for each scroll are needed, but they are stored in a table
with the same size as used by the per-line scrolling mode.  The per-line scrolling mode needs 896
bytes for the NTSC version's 224 line output (960 bytes for the full 240 line resolution of PAL).
Like the vertical offsets, each offset is a 16-bit word and ranges from 0-1023, and the offsets for
Scroll A and Scroll B are interleaved in the horizontal scroll table.</p>

</p>

<p>There are some weird glitches in Scroll B but Scroll A seems to work fine.  It only moves a whole
cell at a time, so Scroll A appears jerky compared to the sprites.  It's especially noticeable at
the edge of the bridge.  The bridge is made of sprites, which can be positioned to the exact pixel,
but the ground where the bridge is supposed to be attached to will only move when a whole cell has
changed.</p>
<h2 id="fixing-line-scrolling">Fixing Line Scrolling</h2>
<p>It had been about a week and a half since I took up the Genesis again.  With the help of the test
ROMs and BlastEm, I had made pretty quick work of a whole bunch of little bugs, going from what was
still a very garbled output to having the games playable.  I wasn't done yet though.</p>
<p>After spending a week working on Computie when my new PCBs arrived, I returned to the Genesis to
work on the per-line scrolling.  I also dabbled a bit with audio support, adding a dummy device for
the YM2612 audio FM synthesizer chip, which is mapped to the Z80 coprocessor's address space, and
fixing the Z80 banked memory area, so that it could access the 68k ROM or RAM data.  With that, I
was able to get the Z80 coprocessor working well enough that Sonic 1 would get past the title screen
and into the game.</p>
<p>I was bothered that per-line scrolling wasn't working, and that the scrolls moved in a jerky
fashion.  I needed to fix it but it would require more than a few simple changes.  Since the
per-cell scrolling was working, I chose to write a completely different version of the
<code>draw_scrolls</code> function just for per-line scrolling.  I could integrate them later if possible but
it would be easier to completely rewrite it without breaking what I already had.</p>
<p>I was still hoping to use the pattern iterator I had written, but I would need to change it to take
the line number on initialization, so that I could output only one line of a pattern at a time.  I
then used another loop inside the horizontal and vertical cell loops to iterate over each of the 8
lines in a pattern, using a different offset for each line of the pattern.</p>
<p>My first attempt used the same loop to draw both scrolls at once, but the results were this:</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/2022-01/sonic2-scrolling-at-once.gif" title="Sonic 2 with both scrolls drawn at once" />
</p>

<p>There is clearly an issue caused by the scrolling since moving until the screen is on a cell
boundary shows the foreground plane (Scroll A) completely on top of the background plane (Scroll B),
but when the offset is between cells, Scroll B is getting drawn on top.  Separating the drawing of
each scroll (at the cost of duplicating the loops) fixed this problem, but there is still an issue
with these strange black artifacts showing on the screen.</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/2022-01/sonic2-scrolling-reversed.png" title="Sonic 2 with black glitches" />
</p>

<p>It took me a while of fussing around with the code before I realized that I had the line and column
coordinates backwards when passing them to the scroll fetching functions.  That's a little
embarrassing.  I was sending the cell_x value to the horizontal scroll offset when it should have
been getting the cell_y value (ie. the horizontal offset is based on what <em>line</em> is currently being
drawn, so you give it the line number and it gives you the x offset).  Swapping these around and
reorganizing the loops fixed this.  Now the scrolling is smooth!</p>
<h2 id="rewriting">Rewriting</h2>
<p>There were still some issues with the left hand and bottom edges of the screen where the foreground
is not drawn to the edge because the scroll offset is not on a cell boundary.  Changing the existing
code to add an extra cell was not as trivial as it would appear.  Shifting the cells over caused the
sprites to be misaligned with the background, and starting the iterators one cell early would mean
starting at <code>-1</code>, which would require changing to signed numbers, and possibly calculating an
invalid offset due to the presence of negatives, or adding many checks to prevent that.</p>
<p>I also didn't have drawing priority working because I didn't have all the cell and sprite priority
bits calculated at the same time, to determine which to display, and the code was awfully messy at
this point.  It was time to rewrite all the display code.  I had learned so much and run into so
many issue by this point.  I had a better understanding of how it was all supposed to work now, and
I could incorporate all those lessons in the next version.</p>
<p>In order to recreate the video output more accurately, I opted to more faithfully simulate what the
hardware VDP would be doing.  Since it's generating a video signal on the fly, it draws the image
pixel by pixel, line by line, exactly in step with the CRT.  If I did it this way, it would also
allow me to implement the priority bits to decide on which pixel from the different planes should be
drawn to the screen, since everything would be in the same loop.  There would be a lot more
duplicated calculations and slower performance as a result, but since the existing performance
wasn't an issue, it should still be fast enough to emulate at full speed.</p>
<p>To make it easier to debug in the short term, I duplicated the code to calculate the cell indices
for the scrolls.  Later, I can break this up into multiple functions to reuse code, and also store
some of the calculated values across iterations to avoid recalculating, but I wanted everything in
one loop to make it easier to adjust while I debugged it.  I did break out the vertical drawing loop
from the horizontal one, which will eventually be used to step through the drawing line by line,
instead of drawing the whole frame before the vertical interrupt, but this isn't yet implemented.</p>

</p>

<p>Finally... It's working pretty good, it scrolls smoothly, it sorts out the priority so Sonic appears
behind the trees.  It works better than this gif even shows.  I recorded it at 15 frames a second
instead of 30 or 60, to keep the file size small, so when Sonic gets his fast boots, it seems like
the sprite isn't animated, but it's actually just moving too fast to be recorded.</p>
<p>For those who are curious, out of each 16.6ms interval between updating a frame, the old display
code was running in around 2ms, and the new code is running in around 6ms, so the new code is
significantly slower (but still well within the time available).  This is in part because I'm
calculating which cell to draw for each of the planes, and fetching the scroll values, for each
pixel on the screen.  This could be improved upon by storing the pattern data for the current cells
for each plane between iterations and only updating them when the cell changes.  That said, doing so
will only make a small improvement in performance, while also making the code harder to read.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This project definitely turned into more than I was expecting when I started.  I had hoped to get
some pretty graphics after only a few weeks of work, (the initial implementation only took about
that long), but that didn't happen and it quickly became my white whale.  I <em>had</em> to finish it.  The
real journey was the eight weeks of switching between debugging and working on other projects while
the problems percolated in the back of my brain.  But I did it.  I got it to a playable (albeit
still buggy) state.</p>
<p>Special thanks to <a href="https://mode5.net/">ComradeOj</a> for the demo ROMs, and <a href="https://twitter.com/mikepavone">Mike
Pavone</a> and the other contributors for
<a href="https://www.retrodev.com/blastem/">BlastEm</a> (<a href="https://github.com/libretro/blastem">github mirror</a>).
Without these, it would have taken a lot more time to get this working.</p>
<p>There is still a lot to do, and I will likely work on this project on and off for a while to come.
Audio needs to be added, and a lot of games don't quite run correctly because of one reason or
another.  Thanks for joining me and I hope you learned something as well, or at least got to enjoy
some nostalgic thoughts of the Sega Genesis.  If there's anything you'd like to me to write more
about or you have any feedback about these posts, I'd love to hear it on twitter or by email.  Happy
Emulating!</p>
