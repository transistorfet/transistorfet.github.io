<h1 id="ruxpinos">RuxpinOS</h1>
<h6 id="started-march-1-2022"><em>Started March 1, 2022</em></h6>
<p>An attempt at making an Operating System in Rust for a Raspberry Pi 3.  Due to
time constraints, I've prioritized getting something that works instead of
trying new ideas, so for now it's a monolithic OS with a Unix-like API, but I
might change that in the future.  I largely copied what I had done for
<a href="https://jabberwocky.ca/projects/gloworm/">Gloworm OS</a> which is written in C.</p>
<p>At the moment, it has support for virtual memory, with on-demand page
allocation, but no support yet for swapping memory to disk.  It has a virtual
file system with support for the ext2 file system, as well as some in-memory
file systems.  It supports multiple processes with context switching triggered
by the system timer, but doesn't yet support multiple threads.</p>
<p>Currently, there is only a console driver (tty subsystem) and sd/emmc card
driver (block device subsystem).  The block driver subsystem provides a
bufcache to cache blocks read from disk by the file system.  Blocks that are
borrowed as mutable are marked dirty and will be written back in the next block
commit.  The ext2 writing support isn't well tested yet, so committing is
disabled for now.</p>
<p>Applications can be written in Rust and compiled with the included libraries,
which use the Aarch64 <code>SVC</code> instruction to perform system calls to the OS.  It
currently supports basic file operations, as well as <code>exit</code>, <code>fork</code>, and
<code>exec</code>.  The OS can directly load the elf binaries produced by cargo as
applications, and run them.  A simple shell program (launched by the kernel
after initialization) and <code>ls</code> command are available, but are only at a proof
of concept stage.</p>
<h2 id="compiling">Compiling</h2>
<p>The OS consists of a kernel and a few applications which are all compiled
separately.  The applications can be loaded in to an ext2 partition, which can
be read by the kernel, but the kernel needs to be loaded separately, so it's
not included in the image.</p>
<p>Normally, when a raspberry pi boots, the firmware looks for a FAT partition on
the microSD card containing the file <code>kernel8.img</code>, which is then loaded at
address <code>0x80000</code> and run.  Once the kernel is running, it can then mount any
other partitions to use as a root file system.  When running in Qemu, the
kernel image is passed on the command line, along with the filename of a disk
image that contains the ext2 partition.</p>
<p>A Makefile is provided in the project root to build the ext2 disk image.  To
make it easier to test the code in qemu or on hardware, it creates a disk image
that looks the same as the microSD card (ie. a FAT partition plus an ext2
partition).  When using qemu, the FAT partition is ignored.</p>
<p>To create an image, from a linux computer run:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>make<span class="w"> </span>create-image
make<span class="w"> </span>load-image
</code></pre></div>

<p>This will create a new 4GB image file, use <code>mkfs.ext2</code> to create a new file
system inside of it, mount it as a loopback device at <code>&lt;project&gt;/build</code>, and
then compile and load the applications into it.  It also copies a hard-coded
partition table into the image, which replicates the partitions used by the
hardware.</p>
<p>Once the image has been created, the kernel can be compiled and run in qemu,
using:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nb">cd</span><span class="w"> </span>config/raspberrypi3/
make
./qemu.sh
</code></pre></div>

<p>To run in on a raspberry pi currently requires a USB serial console.  I'm using
the MiniLoad program from the <a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/rust-raspberrypi-OS-tutorials/">Rust Raspberry Pi OS
Tutorial</a> to
chainload the kernel over the serial port.  It might be possible to put the
compiled kernel image (<code>ruxpin.img</code>) into the boot partition of the created
file and write it to disk, but I haven't tested that yet.</p>
<h2 id="example-output">Example Output</h2>
<p>The following output was copied from the console when run in qemu.  It has a
lot of debug messages to show what's going on.  It starts by setting up the
kernel heap and page memory, registers the filesystem types, initialize the
device drivers, and mounts the root ext2 partition.  It then performs a number
of tests to check basic file system functionality, followed by launching the
first process (the shell).  A command is then typed in, shown between "&lt;&gt;",
which launches the <code>ls</code> program, prints a list of the files and directories in
<code>/</code>, and then exits back to the shell prompt.</p>
